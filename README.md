## Thoughts
I find myself somewhat restrained by the FreeCodeCamp requirements put on each project. To pass the tests, they want you to use specific IDs and classes, and I find their structure doesn’t always coincide with the structure I would like to create. And then I find myself struggling with the CSS a bit.

It’ll be interesting to see if in projects created entirely by me, from scratch, the code will be a bit cleaner. If it’s not, well, then at least I know that there’s something somewhere that I haven’t quite grasped yet, and then I can look into that.
